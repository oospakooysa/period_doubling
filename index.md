# Period Doubling and a Route to Chaos  

![Hero Image: Bifurcation Diagram](images/bifurcation.png)  
*Exploring the boundary between order and chaos in oscillatory systems.*

Welcome! This project explores how simple oscillators evolve into **chaotic motion**.  
Using both **GNU Octave** and **Unreal Engine (UDK)**, I recreated nonlinear systems — from mass-spring oscillators to fairground rides — to make the **period-doubling route to chaos** visible and intuitive.
