# Research Abstract  

This work investigates the transition from linear to nonlinear oscillations, focusing on **period doubling** and the **route to chaos**.  

Key contributions:  
- Reproduction of the **Duffing oscillator bifurcation cascade** in Octave.
- Implementation of nonlinear pendulum dynamics (Skymaster ride) in Unreal Engine.
- Observation of the **jump phenomenon** in forced nonlinear resonance.
- Comparison of simulation frameworks (Octave vs UDK).
- Connection to **Feigenbaum universality**
 \(\delta \approx 4.669201609\)

The results confirm classical nonlinear dynamics theory while highlighting the role of visualization in understanding chaotic motion.
