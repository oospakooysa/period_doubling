# 1. Introduction  

Chaos emerges when simple deterministic rules generate unpredictable, intricate motion. This project follows that path: beginning with linear oscillators, layering in nonlinearity, forcing, and damping, and arriving at the strange world of **period doubling** and the **route to chaos**.  

The goal was not to rely on black-box solvers, but to simulate each system inside **GNU Octave** and the **Unreal Engine (UDK)**, making the physics visible.

# 2. From Linear to Nonlinear Oscillators  

Before diving into chaos, I began with familiar oscillators:  
- **Linear systems** behaved predictably, with smooth sinusoidal motion.  
- **Nonlinear stiffness** introduced subtle distortions.  
- Adding **forcing terms** created rich dynamics, leading to bifurcations.  

## 2.1 Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO)  

\[
m \ddot{x} + kx = 0
\]

Solution:  

\[
x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi), \quad \omega = \sqrt{\tfrac{k}{m}}
\]

ðŸ“Š *Octave simulation:*  

```octave
% SHO: simple harmonic oscillator
m = 1; k = 1;
omega = sqrt(k/m);
t = linspace(0, 20, 1000);
x = cos(omega*t);   % A=1, phi=0
