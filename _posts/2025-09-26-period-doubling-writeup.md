> Exploring nonlinear oscillators and chaos through simulation in **UDK Unreal Engine 3** and **GNU Octave**.

# Introduction  

Nonlinear dynamics sits at a fascinating intersection of mathematics and physics: the moment simple models stop being simple.  

In this project, I recreated fairground rides and suspension systems inside simulation environments. By gradually increasing forcing terms, I observed how stable oscillations transition through **period doubling** into **chaos** ‚Äî the classic Feigenbaum route.  

üìå All simulations were coded manually, rather than relying on built-in physics, to ensure clarity of the underlying math.

# Modeling the System  

The governing equation is the **damped driven harmonic oscillator (DDHO):**

\[
\ddot{x} + \gamma \dot{x} + \omega_0^2 x = F \cos(\omega t)
\]

In Octave, this is implemented as:

```matlab
% rhs_ddho.m
function dx = rhs_ddho(t, x, params)
  dx = zeros(2,1);
  dx(1) = x(2);   % velocity
  dx(2) = -params.gamma * x(2) ...
           - params.omega0^2 * x(1) ...
           + params.F * cos(params.omega * t);
end
```

# Simulation in UDK  

The *SkyMaster* pendulum ride was implemented with custom physics code:  

```uc
// MAS14P_SkyMaster.uc
function Tick(float DeltaTime)
{
    local float torque;
    torque = -Gravity * sin(angle)
             - Damping * angularVelocity
             + DriveAmp * cos(DriveFreq * WorldInfo.TimeSeconds);

    angularVelocity += torque * DeltaTime;
    angle += angularVelocity * DeltaTime;

    logDataRecord(WorldInfo.TimeSeconds, angle, angularVelocity);
}
```

# Period Doubling Cascade  

By sweeping the forcing amplitude, oscillations double in period before entering chaos:  

```matlab
% solve_DDHO_Sweep.m (excerpt)
for F = 1:0.01:2
  [t, x] = ode45(@(t,x) rhs_ddho(t,x,params), [0 200], [0;0]);
  peaks = findpeaks(x(:,1));
  plot(F, peaks, '.k');   % build bifurcation diagram
end
```

# Chaos and Strange Attractors  

At certain parameter values, the oscillator enters chaos. This appears in the time series as irregular oscillations:

And in the phase plane as a folded chaotic attractor:

Even small changes to the starting angle in UDK produced wildly different ride behavior, directly visualizing **chaos in action**.

# The Jump Phenomenon  

Nonlinear systems can also exhibit sudden ‚Äújumps‚Äù between stable and unstable regions. This was captured using the `jump.m` script:  

```matlab
% jump.m
plot(driveAmp, peakPeriods, 'o-');
xlabel('Driving Amplitude');
ylabel('Oscillation Period');

```

# Conclusion  

Through simulation and analysis, I demonstrated:  

- **Period doubling** as a universal route to chaos  
- **Chaotic attractors** emerging from simple pendulum models  
- **Real-world implications** (e.g. unsafe g-forces in rides)

This project bridges theory, simulation, and engineering safety, showing how mathematics of chaos plays out in physical systems.

# Appendix ‚Äì Simulator Comparison  

*(Optional, moved here for focus in the main article)*

- **UDK** provided immersive 3D simulations, but required custom physics.
- **Webots** offered easier integration with Octave but was limited to robotics-focused assets.
