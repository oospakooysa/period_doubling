# Popular Abstract  

What happens when a simple swing refuses to swing simply?  

This project shows how smooth, predictable oscillations can suddenly transform into unpredictable motion — chaos. Using both **GNU Octave** (math-focused) and **Unreal Engine** (visual-focused), I recreated oscillators, fairground rides, and suspension systems to make the journey to chaos visible.  

Key highlights:  
- From simple springs to nonlinear pendulums  
- The “period doubling” cascade into chaos  
- The Skymaster ride as a chaotic pendulum  
- Vehicle suspensions revealing the jump phenomenon  

Chaos isn’t random — it’s deterministic physics, made visible.
