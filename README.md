# Period Doubling and Chaos

This project explores the **period-doubling route to chaos** in nonlinear oscillators.  
It combines numerical simulations, visualisations, and extended writeups to show how simple systems transition from stable periodic motion into complex, chaotic dynamics.  
Along the way, it connects the mathematics to **real-world applications** — from amusement ride safety to suspension systems.

## 📝 Notes

- Originally inspired by a university assignment, but extended into a broader exploration of nonlinear dynamics.  
- Analyses tie back to real-world systems, bridging the gap between **theory and application**.
