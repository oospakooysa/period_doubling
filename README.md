# Period Doubling and a Route to Chaos

This project explores the fascinating **route to chaos via period doubling**, combining both analytical simulations in **GNU Octave** and immersive models in **Unreal Engine 3 (UDK)**.  

The work demonstrates how simple oscillators evolve from predictable, linear systems into rich, chaotic behavior — and how those dynamics can be visualized in real-world analogs like fairground rides.

## 📂 Code

Supporting simulation code is provided in the [`code/`](./code) directory.

### 🔹 [Octave Scripts](./code/octave)  
Numerical models and scripts used to generate bifurcation diagrams, time series, and the jump phenomenon.  
See [`code/octave/README.md`](./code/octave/README.md) for details.

### 🔹 [UDK Assets](./code/udk)  
Unreal Development Kit scripts and level files that reproduce fairground ride dynamics (Skymaster, Apocalypse) in a 3D environment.  
See [`code/udk/README.md`](./code/udk/README.md) for details.

## 🚀 How to Reproduce

- **Octave simulations**  
  Run the `.m` scripts in GNU Octave to reproduce figures from the writeup.  

- **UDK simulations**  
  Install UDK (2015-01 release), copy `.uc` and `.udk` files into the correct folders, and rebuild scripts.

## 📌 Notes

- This project was originally inspired by a university assignment but has been extended and restructured into a full technical + creative demonstration.  
- All code is provided as-is for educational and research purposes.
